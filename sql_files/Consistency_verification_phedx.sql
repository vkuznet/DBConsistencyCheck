-- Description: Performs the same function as consistency_verification_2 but from PhEDEX's side.It iterates over BLOCKS 
-- in PhEDX's T_DPS_BLOCk trying to find the same block in DBS's table of blocks.If the PhEDEX Block is also found in DBS then
-- the procedure moves on to the next block, it does not perform parameter checking processes as that is already handled by 
-- the consistency_verification_2 and if blocks of PhEDEX are present in DBS then their parameters are assumed to have been 
-- checked and handled by the other procedure.This procedure Just detects absence of PhEDX blocks in DBS.
